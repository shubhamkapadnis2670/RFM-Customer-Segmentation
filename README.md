# RFM-Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation is a way to split customers into groups based on certain characteristics that those customers share. All customers share the common need of your product or service, but beyond that, there are distinct demographic differences (i.e., age, gender) and they tend to have additional socio-economic, lifestyle, or other behavioral differences that can be useful to the organization.

# Types of Customer - Segmentation

Six types of customer segmentation models:
Common customer segmentation models range from simple to very complex and can be used for a variety of business reasons. Common segmentations include:
# 1. Demographic:
At a bare minimum, many companies identify gender to create and deliver content based on that customer segment. Similarly, parental status is another important segment and can be derived from purchase details, asking more information from customers, or acquiring the data from a 3rd party.
# 2.Recency, frequency, monetary (RFM):
RFM is a method used often in the direct mail segmentation space where you identify customers based on the recency of their last purchase, the total number of purchases they have made (frequency) and the amount they have spent (monetary). This is often used to identify your High-Value Customers (HVCs).
# 3.High-value customer (HVCs):
Based on an RFM segmentation, any business, regardless of sector or industry, will want to know more about where HVCs come from and what characteristics they share so you can acquire more of them.
# 4.Customer status:
At a minimum, most companies will bucket customers into active and lapsed, which indicates when the last time a customer made a purchase or engaged with you. Typical non-luxury products consider active customers to be those who have purchased within the most recent 12 months. Lapsed customers would those who have not made a purchase in the last 12 months. Customers may be bucketed even further based on the time period in that status, or other characteristics.
# 5. Behavioral:
Past observed behaviors can be indicative of future actions, such as purchasing for certain occasions or events, purchasing from certain brands, or significant life events like moving, getting married, or having a baby. It’s also important to consider the reasons a customer purchases your product/service and how those reasons could change throughout the year(s) as their needs change.
# 6. Psychographic:
Psychographic customer segmentation tends to involve softer measures such as attitudes, beliefs, or even personality traits. For example, survey questions that probe how much someone agrees or disagrees with a statement are typically seeking to classify their attitudes or perspectives towards certain beliefs that are important to your brand.

# RFM Model (Recency, Frequency and Monetary):
Recency, frequency, monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits.
The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:
Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases
RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.
These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or, in the case of a charitable organization, make another donation.

# Performing RFM Segmentation and RFM Analysis, step by step:
Step 1:
The first step in building an RFM model is to assign Recency, Frequency and Monetary values to each customer. The raw data for doing this, which should be readily available in the company’s CRM or transactional databases, can be compiled in an Excel spreadsheet or database.

Step 2:
The second step is to divide the customer list into tiered groups for each of the three dimensions (R, F and M), using Excel or another tool. Unless using specialized software, it’s recommended to divide the customers into four tiers for each dimension, such that each customer will be assigned to one tier in each dimension.

Step 3:
The third step is to select groups of customers to whom specific types of communications will be sent, based on the RFM segments in which they appear.

Step 4:
The fourth step actually goes beyond the RFM segmentation itself: crafting specific messaging that is tailored for each customer group. By focusing on the behavioral patterns of particular groups, RFM marketing allows marketers to communicate with customers in a much more effective manner.
